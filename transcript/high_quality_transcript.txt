In college, I was a government major, which meant I had to write a lot of papers.
I would want to do that.
I was supposed to spend a significant amount of time working on my 90-page senior thesis paper.
I had to go something like this.
How big of a deal it was at first, but then the funniest thing happened. Those first few months came and went, and I couldn't quite get things done. And then...
Two months turned into one month, and then into two weeks. One day, I woke up with just three days until the deadline, having still not written a word. In a frenzy, I managed to write 90 pages in just 72 hours, pulling not one, but several all-nighters. It’s a reminder that humans are not supposed to operate under such pressure.
